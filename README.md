# OpenAI_API_Flutterflow_-Image-Interpretation
This project shows how to integrate OpenAI’s Vision API (gpt-4o or gpt-4-turbo) into a FlutterFlow app to create an AI image assistant. Users submit image URLs; the app sends them to OpenAI for detailed analysis: object detection, text reading, scene description, and contextual insights. Includes Vision API basics, model limits, and pricing.
